# Movie Industry Correlation Analysis

In this project we explored the correlation between budget and gross earnings of a data set. Through our analysis we found that indeed there was a strong correlation between these two variables. After data cleaning, we went on to use simple regression where we plot budget vs gross earnings. The regression showed us that indeed there did appear to be a strong correlation

To verify that we do indeed have a strong correlation we then went on to calculate our correlation and found that indeed these two variables had a correlation coefficient of 0.74 which indicates strong correlation. The resulting correlation matrix was then plotted using a heatmap for some visualization.

Which validates our findings of strong correlation. The full cleaning and analysis used can be [found here.](analysis.ipynb)
